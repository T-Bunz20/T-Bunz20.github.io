        <p>This is my first website. I am just going to 
            share some information about myself</p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am 21 years old, from Renton Washington, and am currently a student at Central Washington University.
            I am majoring in computer science and minoring in math. I currently work as a Lab TA for 
            the CWU computer science department. I basically work as a tutor for the CS department.
            I also play for the CWU club Soccer and club Ultimate Frisbee Teams. I am the president and coach
            of the Ultimate team while also playing on it. Sorry to the ladies who are interested in this stud
            because I am engaged to my best friend and cannot wait to marry her.
